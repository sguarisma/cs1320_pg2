        <h2>Context</h2>
       
        <p>
          Microwaves are an accessible, public interface that users integrate into their daily lives. In my residence hall,
          there is one large microwave used by approximately 40 people. The microwave is known to be a bit sophisticated, including
          multiple buttons with confusing language, a dial, and a small screen used to keep track of time in a busy lounge used for studying, cooking, and socializing.
          The question for this project and the basis for the contextual inquiry performed is what do people think about this microwave? How do they use it? Does it meet expectations?
          Through this project, I will be observing and interviewing three users, creating two personas and one storyboard of an entire user journey to fully encapsulate the experience of a microwave user.
        </p>
       
        <p><b>Annotated Sketch of the Microwave</p> <p>(Focus of the Study)</b></p>

        class="microwave_annotated"
        src="assets/microwave_annotated.png"
        style="width: 75%;"
      />
      <p>The microwave's interface includes 5 major manual setting buttons, 4 buttons related to sensor cooking (for specific meal types), 3 timer/clock related buttons, and 3 start/power/off buttons. The interface also includes one screen that shows the time or setting information, and a dial that can be turned as well as clicked.</p>
      <p>The interface allows users to quickly heat food by interacting with a combination of buttons and a dial. It also allows users to keep track of the time and current setting information on the screen. The goal is to make cooking time adjustments intutive. </p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        
        <p>
          In this project, I observed and interviewed three people using the microwave in my residential hall.
        </p>
        <p><b>
          Key Observations:</b>
        </p>
        <p>Each of the users used different paths to start the microwave. 
          One relied on the clicking the "Express" button multiple times.
          Another manually sets a time with the "Time Cook" button and the dial.
          The third user uses the "Reheat" button, waiting for the microwave to beep and then checked their food before selecting the "Reheat" button again.
         Two of the users opened the microwave before the finalizing beep. Most of the users would check their food partway through heating
          and adjust by either taking the food out and selecting their preferred button again to add more time. 
          Most the users had set buttons/dials to press (they did not stray from their precise buttons), 
          but one of the users tried one path to set timing through the dial. 
          Once they saw this path failed, they tried another different set of buttons that did end up starting the heating process.

        <p><b>Summary of User Responses:</b></p>
        <p>Overall, the users all have routines that they generally stuck to, no matter what they were microwaving. Each of the users has different paths to getting the microwave to start. Most of the users found the dial misleading, finding it unintuitive and suggesting it be replaced with a number pad, similar to microwaves that they've interacted with in the past.
          Some of the users hesitated to experiment with additional features because they prioritized quick, predictable results, but one of the users was prone to experimenting by trial and error, though they always stick with their routine path since they could almost never get anything done with experimenting. Users also mentioned coming back multiple times to restart the reheating process of their food because they found the first reheating wasn't enough. The first time using the microwave showed that the 
          experience has never been intutive- most of the users had to ask nearby friends for help.
          Overall, most of the users didn't engage with the advanced features, like sensor cooking for particular meal types or power/size adjustments. They stuck with what they knew, either because they didn't want to try anything new or because another path had failed.

          To fully represent the spectrum of users that use and may use the microwave, I constructed two personas:

        </div>
  
        <div>
        <p><b>Persona 1: Chill Chris likes to press buttons and see what happens. </b> </p>
        <p>Chris likes to experiment, but, because the microwave lacks clear labeling, he can't figure out how to understand settings other than the one he resorts to. Chris can't adjust heating settings easily and a lot of times ends up with too cold or too hot food.</p>
        <p>Chris represents user groups that like to experiment with the microwave interface. He is a casual user, who represents those that don't necessarily priotize efficiency and isn't afraid to press new buttons. Even then, as all the users from my interviews, he resorts to a single routine when he can't figure out a new one.</p>
        <p><b>Persona 2: Fast Frankie likes to keep it simple and get her food quick. </b></p>
        <p>Frankie finds many problems with the microwave's interface- starting with the unnessary amount of buttons she would need to use to accurately heat up a specific meal type. She gets annoyed looking at the complexity of the microwave, so will always absent-mindedly resort to her one-button route, which usually requires multiple tries to get her food hot enough.</p>
      <p>Frankie represents user who want quick and easy ways to heat up their food without the need for extra features. Frankie and them stick to what they know and avoid complexity when they can.</p>
